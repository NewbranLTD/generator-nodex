This mini generator allow you to create a systemd startup script for use in Linux (that support systemd)

It can be use even without the main installation via nodex

  $ yo nodex:systemd

Just go through the Q&A and it will generate the file for you.
And follow the instruction in the end to install the script.

You can also specify where you want to script to be via --generate-into flag

  $ sudo yo nodex:systemd --generate-into /etc/systemd/system

But it's advice to check the file before you move to the systemd location.
